                    We're paving the way to the stars, one mission at a time.
                </h1>
                <p>Our company derives its name from Icarus, a legendary figure of the ancient Greek mythos.</p>
                <p>
                    Trapped by the king of Crete in a labyrinth designed by his own father Daedalus, he wanted to
                    escape,
                </p>
                <p>
                    so he built wings made out of wood, feathers and wax and flew away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His father had warned him not to defy the Gods, he did not listen: blinded by the joy of flight, he
                    drew too close to the sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The burning rays melted the wax and Icarus fell into the Aegean Sea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The legend is a metaphor of the terrible consequences of passing the limits of human nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Daedalus did, we want to reach new heights and get where no man has aver been before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike him, thanks to our expertise and determination, we're not going to fall.
